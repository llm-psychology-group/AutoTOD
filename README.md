# AutoTOD

This is a fork of the AutoTOD repository.
Modifications made for our evaluations include:
- Added `requirements.txt` for simpler setup
- Implemented a simple Flask API in `app_chatbot.py` for testing the chatbot. Run the app with `python app_chatbot.py`
- Implemented a simple Flask API in `app_user_simulator.py` for testing the user simulator. Run the app with `python app_user_simulator.py`
- Made the Chatbot Agent work with GPT-4 Turbo and implemented some SQL cleaning so that the queries generated by GPT-4 Turbo can be executed.

For the exact modifications, please refer to the [commit history & diff](https://github.com/DaDaMrX/AutoTOD/compare/main...llm-psychology-group:AutoTOD:main)

## New Setup
1. Create a virtual environment and install the requirements:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Set the OpenAI API key in the environment variable in a `.env` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your api key>
```
1. Run the app_chatbot.py to start the chatbot API:
```bash
python app_chatbot.py
```
1. Run the app_user_simulator.py to start the user simulator API:
```bash
python app_user_simulator.py
```


## Original README
AutoTOD is a novel fully zero-shot autonomous agent for task-oriented dialogues. It deprecates all the delicate modules in traditional TOD systems and only uses an instruction-following language model to autonomously call external APIs and communicate with the user, which greatly reduces the construction cost and improves the generalization ability.

# Preparation

## 1. Download preprocessed data

Download the preprocessed data from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18ULn5nmzMMM9dMgGvtdybYcKniwdE3dL/view?usp=sharing) and extract it to the `data` directory.

## 2. Set OpenAI API Key

Provide the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment variable.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your api key>
```
